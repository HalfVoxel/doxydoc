Now you can use the A* <ref refid="namespace_pathfinding" kindref="compound">Pathfinding</ref> Project classes like any other Js script.<linebreak/>
 There is just one thing to note: Unityscript does not support optional parameters, so in some cases you will have to specify more parameters to functions than C# users have to. If you get errors in your code that it cannot find the correct overload for a function you are trying to use, check the docs for the exact parameters to the function and make sure to include all of them. </para>    </detaileddescription>
